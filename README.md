# `mplot`

This repository provides syntax highlighting for my plotting DSL.

## Installation

Recommended method of installation is to use a plugin manager designed for Vim or Neovim.
I personally use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
but there are several alternatives out there.

You can also use the built in package management that comes with Vim 8 or Neovim.
